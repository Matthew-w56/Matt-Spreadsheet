# Comments to Evaluators

	I added checks to make sure the opStack wasn't empty each time it was accessed because it threw errors when I
	tried to see if the stack had a * and it was empty.  That very well could have been part of the assignment (to
	figure that out myself), but since so many other errors are spelled out for the class I figured I'd mention it.


# Assignment Specific Topics
