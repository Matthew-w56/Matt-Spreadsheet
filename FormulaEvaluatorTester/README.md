Personal Statement: I wrote this code myself and did not take it from any other sources other than those listed below.

# Summary

	This project is made to run tests of the Formula Evaluator project.  The Program.cs file contains all the
	test methods, which are designed to provide a 100% code coverage and help give confidence in the working state of the
	class.

# Comments to Evaluators

	Since we are not yet using unit tests, I just wrote a short helper method that prints out any
	errors run into during the test.
