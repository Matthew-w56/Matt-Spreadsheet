# Project Overview

This is a project that I did during my time in CS 3500 at the University of Utah.  For the better part of the semester, we
had guided assignments that lead up to having a "working" spreadsheet program by the end.  At first this was a private repo,
but if the professor continues to have students making a spreadsheet app in a creatively inefficient way in a mobile-first
framework (MAUI), then eventually their projects are going to be online anyways, and I'd like to show off the work I did on
it.

If you are a current student of CS3500, then by reading this code you agree not to use it on your own assignment without
understanding what it is doing.  Otherwise enjoy :).
