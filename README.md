# Overview of the Spreadsheet Functionality

	1. Current Functionality
		Currently, the Solution has a Library that takes care of evaluating the formula
		typed in by the user.  It also has a class that will track the dependencies in the
		cells, and will allow things to get evaluated in the right order.

	2. Future Functionality
		Eventually, the Solution will be a full, working Spreadsheet program that allows the user to use
		mathematical formulas between cells, input information, and safe and retrieve their files.
