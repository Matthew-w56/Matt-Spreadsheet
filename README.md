# Overview of the Spreadsheet Functionality

	1. Current Functionality
		This project includes a GUI that allows the user to create and edit Spreadsheets.  The
		libraries in this Solution include classes that include objects like Formulas, Dependency
		Graphs, and the Spreadsheet itself.  The user can save the sheets to files and reload them,
		and is assisted by an in-program help menu that explains basic content.

	2. Future Functionality
		I'm uncertain if the next assignment continues to build on this.  Maybe nothing, maybe
		something.

# Time Estimate Growth

	I have gotten better at estimating my time for these assignments.  Part of this is learning how much will be
	expected of us for each week, and what kinds of things I will be doing for it.  Another part, the larger part,
	is that I am getting better at understanding what different tasks takes and how much I can expect to be testing
	and debugging that project.

# Time Expenditures:
	(Future assignments' predicted time TBD)

	Assignment				Predicted	Actual		Notes
	1 - Formula Evaluator	5			2:30		Last half hour spend documenting
	2 - Dependency Graph	4			3:12		Fought with Stress test for 1.5 hours
	3 - Formula Class		4			4:45		Spent 30 minutes adjusting Visual Studio settings
	
	Better Time Breakout (Should have done this earlier)
	Assignment				Predicted	Coding		Debugging	Testing		Documenting	Total		Notes
	4 - Spreadsheet Class	5			0:45		0:03		1:18		0:35		2:41
	5 - Spreadsheet Saving	7			1:40		1:45		0:31		0:25		4:21
	6 - MAUI GUI			9			6:20		1:43		0:40		1:25		10:08		1:15 - making it look nice.    1:50 - Added feature
